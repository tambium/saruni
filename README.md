# Saruni

Saruni is a web application framework that uses a modern stack to improve developer experience. Our goal is for small development teams to feel comfortable writing and deploying world-class applications without breaking a sweat. Saruni offers sensible defaults for common challenges but makes every effort to give developers control.
