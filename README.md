# Saruni

Saruni is a web application framework that uses a bleeding-edge stack to improve developer experience. Our goal is for small development teams to be comfortable building world-class applications without breaking a sweat. Saruni suggests helpful conventions but makes every effort to give control to the developer.

## Technologies

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
  Fast, simple and scalable. A no-brainer.

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
  Performant static sites with one-click deployments, and thousands of plugins available as the cherry on top.

- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
  Use of GraphQL means clients can query the precise data fields their use case calls for, with always-up-to-date documentation available for reference. This is a welcome change compared with a traditional REST API, where clients adhere to the strict scope of data made available through endpoints.

- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
  Writing Prisma schemas is easy, even with limited understanding of SQL relations. That means we can get moving with a database quickly. What’s more, we get typed client generation for free. Win-win.

- [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/)
  Using Serverless means we can deploy through any FaaS provider and expect substantial cost savings. Though it adds some overhead in the maintenance of a custom development server, this approach should mean less time watching over and resolving issues with virtual machines.

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
  Using a tried-and-tested traditional, relational database means we have access to great documentation and practically endless deployment options.
